## Overview
The Employee Management System is designed to provide a convenient way to manage employee records. It utilizes JavaScript and the DOM to dynamically update the web page and handle user interactions. The application allows users to perform various operations, such as adding new employees, editing existing records, and sorting the employee table based on different columns.

## Features
- Add new employees: Users can input employee details, such as name, position, and salary, and add them to the table.
- Edit existing employees: Users can modify the information of existing employees directly within the table.
- Data validation: The system validates the input data to ensure the entered information is in the correct format.
- Sorting functionality: Users can click on any column header to sort the table based on that column. Clicking the same column again will reverse the sorting order.
